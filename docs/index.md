# Welcome to `ghcnsnowprocess` module

This is implemented to improvise by preprocessing of raw data from GHCN-Daily station measurement by preprocessing the unique station measurement elements to the stations across the globe and export into workable excel sheets.

The module provides concise functionalities to handle DLY format station-wise, measuring variable type-wise accordingly. The repository `ghcnsnowprocess` consists of three componenet:

1. ghcnsnow
2. tutorial
3. README file

`ghcnsnow` folder contains python code for all processing, while `tutorial` provides an example section of the module conduct by Jupyter notebook to preprocess. These source codes are implemented based on inspiration from GHCN-Daily Version 3.30.
